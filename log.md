# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: January 2nd 2017
##### (KINDA-When I started writing this it was)

**Today's Progress**: Decided to commit to #100daysofcode, and I'm going to Use Python. Although I might decide to do some freecodecamp projects here and there as I've been wanting to learn Web Development.

**Thoughts:** Well right now it is technically 1/3/2017, 12:05AM at night and I haven't slept yet so It's still technically Day 0. I plan to do my coding tomorrow around 2-6pm. I have an idea of what I want to start working on. Since I've been learning Data Science and how to use things like Selenium, and Beautifulsoup; I want to build a project that checks stock market info for tech companies like facebook, google, etc and puts it into a DataFrame(since I'm getting into pandas at the moment). I just got the idea that I could also make it into an alexa app and have alexa get me the stock market values for a certain company I ask for... We'll see :D. 

####NOTE TO SELF: During these 100 days would be a good time to work on the what should I wear and other skillets xD

### Day 1: January 3rd 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a scraper that lets takes the input of a user, but it has to be the stock market abbreviation/name of a company, and scrapes yahoo's financial page for that company, and returns the results in a pandas DataFrame. :). I was going to make it so that it would ask you if you wanted to scrape again but I ran into a lot of trouble doing that for some reason, and it took me way too long to work on that when I wasn't even finished with getting the data into a DataFrame, so I dropped that, and decided to finish the basic functionality of the code. I'm planning to add on to the code as I go along and add more functionality to it. Wish me luck!

**Thoughts**: I have a seperate log that I put in 100-days-of-code/Projects/Day(X) that I write to locally as I run into problems and things. But I will also write my thoughts to this log... I ran into a lot of problems with what I wanted to do today, and kept thinking that I was done, but then ran into another issue. I spent way more than an hour on what I did, and I'm happy I stuck with it and finished the first day :D. They say the hardest part of doing things is taking that first step and getting starting/ commiting to something. I hope that I'll be able to stick with this! Also, it's 12:41am 1/4/2017 right now but as the rules stated, it still counts for the other day because I haven't gone to sleep yet, and I was actually doing the majority of my coding before 12am(it took me a while to finish this project :X). Anyway I can't wait to have some more fun tomorrow! :D

### Day 2: January 4th 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not much today. Just a program that gets the top 10 new posts from any subreddit using reddits api and relays it back to you.

**Thoughts**: I first wanted to do something using selenium; I wanted to get the last game score for any hockey team that the user wanted.. It wasn't going well at all, so about a half hour in, I scratched it and then decided to do what I did. I plan on making one or two more scraper like programs(note to self: twitter), and put it all into a GUI with buttons for each of them using PyQT. I was going to stop after I scratched the selenium program, but forced myself to think and keep coding. I'm glad I did, and I'm glad I've at least gotten to Day 2! :D

### Day 3: January 5th 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made the basic layout for my GUI using tkinter instead of PyQt... I organized the GUI and now I'm working on the functionality of the buttons and the Entry's.. I was also working on how I was going to display the data back to the 'user' and found I can use a messagebox, so I was also toying with that... Fun day!

**Thoughts**: I was going to use PyQt at first, but ran into a whole bunch of trouble. I sat down to code at like 9 o'clock again... Messing around trying to get PyQt going took me an hour, maybe even longer. I was sooo pissed off because I've using PyQt before, and I probably would've gotten more done today... But anyway I decided to go with tkinter, which isn't to hard to use.. I got some help from tutorialspoint-- which isn't what it sounds like... They just show you the commands and the syntax for certain things and explain them.. But anyway, getting the positioning to look somewhat good was kind of a challenge, but I ended up with something that didn't look too bad(I think). I started to work on making the reddit scrape button run a function that takes the input from the entry box and calls my redditscaper, then returns the data and shows it in a message box.. I have some errors, but It's a work in progress- so I'll work more on it tomorrow :). For now, I'm super tired since it's 2:26 AM; but I'm glad I stuck with my commitment AGAIN, and made it to Day 3... It's making me feel good and I don't even look at the time; it just flies by and then I notice it's 2:30AM and I'm like FUUUUU NOT AGAIN! Lol... Anyway; I had a lot of fun, and I already feel like this is really helping me improve! I can't imagine how I'd feel after like 50! Looking foward to work more on this tomorrow.

### Day 4: January 6th 2017

**Today's Progress**: I would like to think that I got a lot done today.. :D I added functionality to my GUI... The reddit part is basically fully complete, you type the subreddit, click the button, and get a new window with about 10 of the hottest headlines for that subreddit. Also, the stocks part is technically functional but not complete. You can type the abbreviations, click the button, and get a new window with a DataFrame, but the entry is not taking the input correctly because I forgot to set it up; and the DataFrame is displaying all yucky.

**Thoughts**: I feel like I got a lot done, and when I first got the reddit part to work completely I felt really happy that I accomplished that and wanted to keep moving foward and make it look nicer. I made it look as nice as I can using basic fonts and stuff for now.. I ran into a few problems here and there, but nothing that was too crazy to figure out.. I had a fun day and I'm really glad I'm doing this and I hope that I'll stick with it for the full 100 days because I know that I will grow so much. For now, I'm tired as shit.
