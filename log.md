# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: January 2nd 2017
##### (KINDA-When I started writing this it was)

**Today's Progress**: Decided to commit to #100daysofcode, and I'm going to Use Python. Although I might decide to do some freecodecamp projects here and there as I've been wanting to learn Web Development.

**Thoughts:** Well right now it is technically 1/3/2017, 12:05AM at night and I haven't slept yet so It's still technically Day 0. I plan to do my coding tomorrow around 2-6pm. I have an idea of what I want to start working on. Since I've been learning Data Science and how to use things like Selenium, and Beautifulsoup; I want to build a project that checks stock market info for tech companies like facebook, google, etc and puts it into a DataFrame(since I'm getting into pandas at the moment). I just got the idea that I could also make it into an alexa app and have alexa get me the stock market values for a certain company I ask for... We'll see :D. 

####NOTE TO SELF: During these 100 days would be a good time to work on the what should I wear and other skillets xD

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
