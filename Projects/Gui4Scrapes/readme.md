#Home of Gui4Scrapes

So on Day 1 of my #100DaysOfCode I made one of the scrapers, then the next day I made another scraper. I thought to myself- Ok, your not going to make scrapers every single day for 100 days.. So I decided to make a GUI for my scrapers :D. It was really fun to make this, and I hope to make some more beautiful GUIs in the future!

Here is the main GUI screen(It's not the prettiest, but neither am I xD):
